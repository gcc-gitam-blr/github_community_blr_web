# GitHub Community Club BLR

Website for the GitHub Community Club, Bengaluru — **Learn. Build. Merge.** — plus **Epoch**, our annual fest: registration, Epoch Coins, QR scanning, a shop and a live leaderboard.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Framework | **Next.js (App Router) + React + TypeScript** | Routing, server-rendered club site, and real app screens for Epoch |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS v4** | Design tokens in `app/globals.css`; the signature animations are plain CSS keyframes + Motion |
| Motion | **Motion** (`motion/react`) | Scroll reveals, the club → Epoch page transition, coin/QR result animations |
| Backend | **Supabase** (Postgres + GitHub OAuth) | Shared coin balances across every phone. Optional — see below |
| QR | `qrcode.react` (generate) + `html5-qrcode` (camera scan) | Wallet passes and stall codes |

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

Epoch works out of the box in **demo mode** (data lives in your browser's localStorage — register a few accounts and scan between them to try the flow).

## Make it yours

- Club content (events, tracks, team, FAQ, socials): [`lib/config.ts`](lib/config.ts)
- Epoch settings (dates, welcome coins, stalls, rewards): [`lib/epoch/config.ts`](lib/epoch/config.ts)

Set `githubOrg` in `lib/config.ts` and the Projects section lists your real repos.

## Epoch: going live for the fest

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Run [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql) in the SQL editor. All coin movement happens in database functions, so a tampered browser can't mint coins, and each stall works once per attendee.
3. Enable **Authentication → Providers → GitHub**, with redirect URL `https://<your-domain>/epoch/register`.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the URL and anon key.
5. After you sign in once, make yourself admin: `update profiles set role = 'admin' where handle = 'your-handle';`
6. Open `/epoch/admin`, **print the QR sheet**, and put one code on each stall table.

**Epoch mode:** the *EPOCH* item in the nav and the black-disc page transition are always there; the live dot and countdown follow `opensAt`/`closesAt`. Force it with `NEXT_PUBLIC_EPOCH_MODE=live|off`.

### How coins flow

- Attendee registers → +100 EPC welcome bonus.
- Attendee scans a **stall QR** (`epoch:s:<id>`) → earns (or pays) that stall's amount, once per stall.
- Organiser scans an **attendee wallet QR** (`epoch:u:<id>`) → awards or deducts coins manually.
- Shop redeems coins for rewards; stock is decremented atomically.
